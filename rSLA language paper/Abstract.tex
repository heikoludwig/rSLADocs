Today's application environments combine Cloud and on-premise infrastructure as well as platforms and services from different providers to enable  quick development and 
delivery of solutions to their intended users. The ability to use 
Cloud platforms to stand up applications in a short time frame, the - now - wide availability of services, and the application of a continuous deployment model has led to a much more dynamic application environment.

Managing quality of service has become more important because the more external service vendors are involved the  
less control an application owner has and must rely on  Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Also, 
services from different vendors expose different instrumentation. In addition, the increasing dynamism of application environments entails that the speed of SLA monitoring set up must match the speed of changes to the 
application environment.  

This paper proposes the rSLA service and language that is both flexible enough to instrument virtually any environment and agile enough to scale and update SLA management as needed. Using rSLA the time of setting up SLA compliance monitoring 
of application environments involving infrastructure, platform, and application services can be significantly reduced.
