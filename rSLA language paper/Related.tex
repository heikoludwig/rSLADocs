rSLA enables rapid cloud deployment of SLA management services. Currently in cloud markets there is no application that provides service level management on-demand, given the availability of a cloud platform.

The scientific literature has proposed language specifications \cite{wsla, wsag} for SLAs that are executed over web and/or distributed computing environments. Such language specifications have been used in numerous grid or cloud research initiatives \cite{soi, butler, cslam}. The research community has also looked into solutions for SLA negotiation, efficient resource distribution and for quality of service execution  \cite{SNAP, lessons}.

In the industry, however, cloud providers have not yet adopted automated SLA management solutions. Instead, third-party services like ServiceNow \cite{servicenow} or Amazon Redshift \cite{redshift} are used by cloud providers to handle their service management and data warehousing needs.
