Notes from the discussion yesterday

tune the argumentation: introduction should be clear: overview of paper, 

value proposition, overall motivation

Xlet abstraction, 
sla language  xlets, easy to use language, run it as a service, fast to deploy, solution for sla management and cheap the 

clarify why now: dealing with heterogeneity (wsla applications in application server) notion of service is much more vigor, micro services,  extensibility and customizability, the introduction of devops make infrastructure changes more often than code changes, code agility, 

cloud apps today are being solved by horizontal scaling, once we deploy latency intensive applications SLAs become a must. 

related work why we are doing this, no other comparable solution

notion of service, metric in the abstract

capture the whole runtime

why now: we are running on shared everything infrastructures, the desire to use SLAs is greater
