Cloud SLA management can be costly. A provider needs to control resources that are used by multiple tenants. Every tenant agrees on service levels that can be different from those of other customers. To guarantee service level compliance, a provider monitors service level values and schedules measurement and evaluation operations for all active service level agreements. 

Such practices require monitoring, scheduling and data storage tools that can be tedious to deploy for someone unfamiliar with IT. In addition, such practices are performed systematically. The rSLA DSL can be deployed as a cloud service and provide such service level management practices following a systematic schedule. The rSLA deployment in a cloud environment is inexpensive and fast as rSLA has minimal external tool dependencies.
