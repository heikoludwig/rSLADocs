\label{sec:introduction}

rSLA is a domain specific language (DSL) for expressing and managing service level agreements (SLAs) in a cloud environment. rSLA is written with Ruby 
\cite{ruby}, a dynamic scripting language that enables rapid prototyping and application development. The rSLA DSL is described by an alphabet and by 
production rules for using and extending the language. The rSLA language framework also provides a runtime engine to deploy and instantly run an rSLA 
service in a cloud environment.

Cloud service management does not yet support enough automated and transparent solutions for the management of leased resources. There is no 
established standard so far for the automatic expression and management of SLAs for cloud services.

Although the scientific literature provides plentiful results on the automated management of SLAs for distributed computing \cite{wsla, wsag, more}, 
cloud markets hesitate to adopt such solutions. Provisioning of cloud services is thus handled either manually or with software tools that do not 
embrace cloud service characteristics.

The rSLA is deployed on the IBM Bluemix platform as a ruby web service using the sinatra gem. 
The DSL enables the automated generation of customized SLAs and the transparent management of cloud resources.
what problem does it solve? why is it needed?

rSLA provides an alphabet with production rules to express, a runtime engine to run.
