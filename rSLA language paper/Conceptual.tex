Cloud SLA management can be costly. A provider needs to control resources that are used by multiple tenants. Every tenant agrees on service levels that can be different from those of other customers. To guarantee service compliance, a provider must monitor service level values and schedule measurement and evaluation operations for all active service level agreements. 

Such practices require instrumentation of monitoring, scheduling and data storage tools that can be tedious to deploy for someone unfamiliar with IT. In addition, such practices are performed systematically.  A semantic vocabulary is required for their management.

Deployment of the rSLA as a cloud service reduces the overall deployment time for cloud SLA management and provides an inexpensive, on-demand solution for the methodical execution of previously mentioned SLA practices.
